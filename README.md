# Maple library

This repository contains an extensive library of Maple code for
various areas of pure mathematics.  You can read in the file
`lib/_ALL.mpl`, and this will in turn read in most of the other
files.  This is the recommended way to proceed, as loading individual
files directly will probably lead to unsatisfied dependencies.
